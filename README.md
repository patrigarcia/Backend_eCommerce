# ðŸ’»â€Š E-commerce Backend Project 

## REST API development for e-commerce


<span style="color: fuchsia;">**The included functionalities are as follows:**</span>

1. Product category management.
2. Product inventory management.
3. User management (login, logout, registration, roles).
4. Order management.

<span style="color: fuchsia;">**The backend architecture functionalities:**</span>


- Product category management: Allows the creation, update, and deletion of product categories.
- Product inventory management: Enables the administration of product inventory, including the creation, update, and deletion of products.
- User management: Provides functions for user registration, login and logout, permission management, and user roles.
- Order management: Allows the creation and management of customer orders.

<span style="color: fuchsia;">****Technologies used in the backend architecture:****</span>

- **Database:** <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**MySQL**</span> has been used as the database to store information related to categories, products, users, and orders.
- **ORM Framework:** <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Sequelize**</span> is used as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to facilitate interaction with the MySQL database.
- **Backend technology:** <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Node.js**</span> has been used to develop the backend application, leveraging its ability to handle requests and responses asynchronously.
- **Web server:** <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Express**</span> is utilized as a web server framework for Node.js, enabling request routing and implementation of API endpoints.

- Relevant tests for all API endpoints have been conducted using the <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Postman**</span> application.

- Use of <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Bcrypt:**</span> Regarding security aspects, user passwords are encrypted using the hashing technique, which consists of concatenating the password with a randomly generated string called "salt".

- Furthermore, the user login generates a token on the server following the <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**JSON Web Token (JWT)**</span> scheme. This token is then used to validate calls to non-public endpoints.

- General development with <span style="color: #00BFFF;">**Javascript**</span>: Allows for efficient handling of asynchronous requests and seamless API integration.

## Project Development ðŸ”§

The project was completed within a seven-day timeframe as part of an exercise for **The Bridge Valencia's FullStack Bootcamp**.

It consists of three core files: index.html, main.js, and style.css.
The game logic was developed first, and then followed by the definition of styles.

The necessary functions were implemented to execute the code as efficiently as possible.

## Technologies Used ðŸ’»

Up to this point in the course, the technologies learned and used were the following:

-   HTML.
-   CSS.
-   JavaScript (including SPA and API usage with Axios).
-   Bootstrap Framework.

## Future work

1. Allow the user to select the question's theme, difficulty and number of questions to be answered.
2. Play sounds when players gets correct/incorrect answers.
3. Show a graph with the best players according to their scores.
4. Show a picture on every question for visual hint.
